<h3><center>Business Operations</center></h3>
<p><strong>Financing, Operating and Investing are the three major activities in business operations.</strong>
    Financing deals with the initial startup of the  business as well funding the business throughout its lifetime.
    When a business owner seeks a loan from a bank or SBA,
    issues stock to investors, or a combination of both, the owner becomes part of the <strong>capital market</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Investing</strong> has to do with buying tools for a business.  Examples: a cash register, machinery, land.
</p>

<p>
    <strong> Operating activity</strong> takes care of day-to-day operations of a business by selling/creating products,
    providing services, or both.
</p>

<p>
    Business creates a enormous amount of <strong>data</strong>.
    Think of how many sales a single <i>Walmart</i> makes in a day!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Four fundamental financial documents represent this data
</p>

<h2><center>Four Statements</center></h2>

<center><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EaSkW-ZnVmMbwTpMAJuE9uewi49VxSwNNkr1MUv8XL4/edit?usp=sharing">
    Integrated Financial Statements</a>
</center>
<br>
<div class="title">Cash Flow Statement</div>

<p><strong>Cash flow statement</strong>  is the checkbook of the business.  It covers a period of time vs. a snapshot (balance sheet)

</p>

<p>
    Cash flow covers transactions from <a href="https://kironroy.github.io/biz_oper">operations, financing, and investing</a>
</p>

<p>
    Cash is a liquid asset on the Balance Sheet <i>A = L + E</i>
</p>

<p>
    <i>Liquidity </i> is a termed used to denote whether or not a
    business is generating cash from its assets or convert its assets into cash quickly
</p>

<p>
    Cash is <strong>not profit.</strong>  A business can generate a cash but not necessarily make a profit.
    Conversely, a profitable business doesn't necessarily have cash-flow.
</p>

<p><strong> When validating a business, most investors look at the cash-flow statement, rather than the income statement.
    This is to check if there is a healthy flow of money going into the business, then coming out of it.
</strong> </p>

<br>

<div class="title">Balance Sheet</div>
<p><strong>The Balance Sheet</strong>  is a snapshot (instance in time).  It measures the  financial condition of a business
    with respect to its total assets and claims or rights to those assets.  Note the balance statement does not <strong>change over time</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    Most important Equation:
    <strong><i> Assets = Liabilities + Owner Equity</i></strong>
</p>

<p>
    Balance sheet insolvency: <strong><i> Assets < Liabilities + Owner Equity</i></strong>
    Think of a house that you bought for $200k but now is worth $140k.  Even if you sell all your assets you cannot payoff the
    liabilities.
</p>

<p>
    Balance sheet insolvency  is different than <strong> cash flow insolvency</strong>, in that a business may have assets,
    but cannot convert the assets quickly enough to pay bills (Also known as <strong>liquidity</strong>).
</p>

<br>


<div class="title">Income Statement</div>

<p><strong>Income statement </strong> shows booked income and the costs and expenses associated with making that income.</p>

<p>Income statement <strong> DOES NOT show cash-flow</strong>.  Cash flow is separate statement.</p>



<br>


<div class="title">Earnings Statement</div>
<p><strong>Retained Earnings Statement</strong> reports accumulated retained earnings at beginning of the
    year and the addition of any net income that will be added to that retained earnings.</p>

<p>
    <i>Retained Earnings = Previous R.E. + Net Income - Dividends Paid</i>
</p>

<p>
    It also reports dividends issued to investors.
    Dividends are cash payments made out to shareholders and are an type of cash out-flow.
</p>

<p>
    Three things can be determined by the Earnings statement:
</p>
<p> 1. Give some or all money (dividends) to investors</p>
<p> 2. Save the money for inside the business </p>
<p> 3. Combination of 1 and 2 </p>


<p>
    Retained earning <strong> does not </strong> report what is done with the retained earnings or cash-flow.
    It just reports the earnings.
