    <h3>
        <center>Business Operations</center>
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Financing, Operating and Investing are the three major activities in business operations.</strong>
        Financing deals with the initial startup of the business as well funding the business throughout its lifetime.
        When a business owner seeks a loan from a bank or SBA,
        issues stock to investors, or a combination of both, the owner becomes part of the <strong>capital
            market</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Investing</strong> has to do with buying tools for a business. Examples: a cash register, machinery,
        land.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong> Operating activity</strong> takes care of day-to-day operations of a business by selling/creating
        products,
        providing services, or both.
    </p>

    <p>
        Business creates a enormous amount of <strong>data</strong>.
        Think of how many sales a single <i>Walmart</i> makes in a day!
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Four fundamental financial documents represent this data</strong>
    </p>

    <div class="title">Cash Flow Statement</div>

    <p><strong>Cash flow statement</strong> is the checkbook of the business. It covers a period of time vs. a snapshot
        (balance sheet)

    </p>

    <p>
        Cash flow covers transactions from <strong>operations, financing, and investing.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Cash is a liquid asset on the Balance Sheet <i>A = L + E</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>Liquidity </i> is a termed used to denote whether or not a
        business is generating cash from its assets or convert its assets into cash quickly
    </p>

    <p>
        Cash is <strong>not profit.</strong> A business can generate a cash but not necessarily make a profit.
        Conversely, a profitable business doesn't necessarily have cash-flow.
    </p>

    <p><strong> When validating a business, most investors look at the cash-flow statement, rather than the income
            statement.
            This is to check if there is a healthy flow of money going into the business, then coming out of it.
        </strong> </p>

    <br>

    <div class="title">Balance Sheet</div>
    <p><strong>The Balance Sheet</strong> is a snapshot (instance in time). It measures the financial condition of a
        business
        with respect to its total assets and claims or rights to those assets. Note the balance statement does not
        <strong>change over time</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most important Equation:
        <strong><i> Assets = Liabilities + Owner Equity</i></strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Balance sheet insolvency: <strong><i> Assets < Liabilities + Owner Equity</i> </strong> Think of a house that
                    you bought for $200k but now is worth $140k. Even if you sell all your assets you cannot payoff the
                    liabilities. </p> <p>
                    Balance sheet insolvency is different than <strong> cash flow insolvency</strong>, in that a
                    business may have assets,
                    but cannot convert the assets quickly enough to pay bills (Also known as
                    <strong>liquidity</strong>).
    </p>

    <br>


    <div class="title">Income Statement</div>

    <p><strong>Income statement </strong> shows booked income and the costs and expenses associated with making that
        income.</p>

    <p>Income statement <strong> DOES NOT show cash-flow</strong>. Cash flow is separate statement.</p>



    <br>


    <div class="title">Earnings Statement</div>
    <p><strong>Retained Earnings Statement</strong> reports accumulated retained earnings at beginning of the
        year and the addition of any net income that will be added to that retained earnings.</p>

    <p>
        <i>Retained Earnings = Previous R.E. + Net Income - Dividends Paid</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        It also reports dividends issued to investors.
        Dividends are cash payments made out to shareholders and are an type of cash out-flow.
    </p>

    <p>
        Three things can be determined by the Earnings statement:
    </p>
    <p> 1. Give some or all money (dividends) to investors</p>
    <p> 2. Save the money for inside the business </p>
    <p> 3. Combination of 1 and 2 </p>


    <p>
        Retained earning <strong> does not </strong> report what is done with the retained earnings or cash-flow.
        It just reports the earnings.
