### Algorithm Guidelines
1. Clearly defined problem statement, input and output
1. The steps in the algorithm need to be in a specific order
1. The steps need to be distinct, no sub-tasks
1. Algorithms should produce a result
1. Algorithms should complete in a finite amount of time
These steps will lead to Algorithmic thinking 

**_Time Complexity:_** How long an algorithm will take to run

**_Space Complexity:_** Amount of memory taken by a computer 

**_Constant Time - O(1):_** The runtime of the algorithm is independent of the size of the data set. If n is 1 or 1 million it takes the same amount of time to execute the algorithm

**_Logarithmic Time - O(log n):_** The runtime of the algorithm increases logarithmically as the size of the data set increases

**_Linear Time - O(n):_** The runtime of the algorithm is directly proportional to the size of the data set

**_Quadratic Time - O(n^2):_** The runtime of the algorithm increases by a factor of n squared as the size of the data set increases

**_Quasilinear Time - O(n log n):_** Given a data set of size n, the algorithm executes an n number of operations where each operation runs in log n (logarithmic) time

**_Polynomial runtimes - O(n ^ k):_** An algorithm is considered to have a polynomial runtime if, for a given value of n, it's worst case runtime is in the form of n raise to the k power. Examples of this are O(n^2) and O(n^3). Algorithms with polynomial runtimes are considered efficient.

_**Exponential runtime - O(k^n):**_ A runtime where number of operations increases exponentially as the size of the data set increases. Exponential runtimes are considered inefficient.

**_Combinatorial or factorial runtime - O(n!):_** Runtimes where as the size of n increases the number of operations increases by n! where n! is the factorial of n.
