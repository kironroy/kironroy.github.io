    <ul>
        <li>What is the state of the industry in which the business operates? Is the industry in growth mode, or is it
            mature or in decline?</li>
        <li>What is the state of the business’s target market? Is its target market growing or shrinking? Are its target
            customers undergoing demographic changes, such as aging, loss of disposable income, or other transitions
            that could put the business at risk?</li>
        <li>Is the business’s customer base growing? Is the business adequately diversified, or is it overly dependent
            on one or two big customers?</li>
        <li>How does this business compare to competitors in its industry? How many competitors are there? What are
            their strengths and weaknesses?</li>
        <li>What is the state of the region where the business is located? Are people moving into the area or are they
            moving out? What about businesses? Is the local economy growing or shrinking?</li>
        <li>What kind of staff does the business have? Do employees have skills that are difficult to find elsewhere?
            Are their wages average, above average, or below average for the industry? What benefits does the company
            offer?</li>
        <li>Is there a lot of turnover at the company? How long have key employees been with the company? Are key
            personnel likely to stay with the company after a change in ownership?</li>
        <li>What is the company’s reputation in the industry and the community? Businesses are often up for sale because
            of problems the owner may try to hide. Go online and ask around in the community to learn as much as you can

        5 Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
    </div>
    <p><a href="https://www.allbusiness.com/buying-a-business-5-essential-kpis-to-review-112437-1.html">Source</a></p>
    <p><strong>1. Customer acquisition cost</strong></p><strong>Customer acquisition cost = dollar amount you spend on
        sales and marketing in order to require a new customer.</strong> The number indicates efficiency of marketing
    and is calculated by <i>Total number of customers / Total acquisition costs</i>. If the company you are looking at
    is spending too much, consider the options of refining the marketing strategy and more efficiently allocating the
    budget.
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>2. Customer retention rate</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Customer retention rate = customers who come back regularly for goods and services</strong> High
        retention rates include: <i>High quality product at a competitive price, customer support, and customer
            satisfaction.</i></p>
    <p><strong>3. Profit margin</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Profit margin = "markup" how much a product or service's revenue exceeds its cost to the
            business.</strong> Business with low margins are vulnerable to drops in sales or poor market share. This
        will raise concern about long-term sustainability.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Overhead</strong></p><strong>refers to fixed expenses outside labor and production costs.</strong>
    Rent, utilities, and insurance are all examples of overhead expenses. When compared to overall revenue, overhead can
    indicate a company’s efficiency.
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>5. Employee turnover</strong></p>
    <p>High employee turnover could be a red flag that current management isn’t engaging staff or rewarding strong
        individual or company performance. If you’re considering a business with high turnover, revamp employee
        policies.</p>

        Financial Accounting (Libby, Libby, and Short)
    </div>
    <p>
        Most companies list assets in order of liquidity or how soon an asset is expected by management to be turned into cash or used.

Liabilities are usually listed on the balance sheet in order of maturity (how soon an obligation is to be paid).  

Managers business decisions often result in transactions that affect the financial statement.  Decisions to expand the number of stores, advertise a new product, change and employee benefit package and invest excess cash would affect the financial statement.  The decision to purchase additional inventory for cash in anticipation of a major sales will increase inventory and decrease cash.  But if there is no demand for additional inventory, the lower cash balance will also reduce the company’s ability to pay its other obligations.

</p>
<p>
Operating Cycle:  The long term objective for any business is to turn cash into more cash.  If a company is to stay in business, this excess must be generated from operations that is from activities for which the business was established, not from borrowing money or selling long-lived assets.
