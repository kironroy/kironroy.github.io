		Economics is the study of how scarce resources are allocated among competing uses.
		<ol>
			<li>What is produced?</li>
			<li>How is it produced?</li>
			<li>Who gets what is produced?</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Production Possibility frontier</strong> = The alternative combinations of final goods and services that could be produced in a given time period with all available and limited resources and technology.</p>
		<p><strong>Opportunity Cost</strong> = Obtaining more production of one good, amounts reduction in the production (lost opportunity) of one or more other goods.</p>
		<p><strong>Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost</strong> = Obtaining more of a good in equal amounts requires giving up ever larger amounts of alternative goods.</p>
		<p><strong>Inside Frontier</strong> = Unemployed resources used inefficiently Expanding frontier occurs when resources are increased and/or technological advancements.</p>
		<p><strong>Utility</strong> = is the satisfaction obtanined by the consumer from consuming a good.</p>
		<p><strong>Marginal Utility (MU)</strong> = is the extra utility from additional unit of consumption.</p>
		<p><strong>Principle of Diminishing Marginal Utility</strong> = Additional consumer satisfaction from the last unit of consumption falls as more of the good is consumed.</p>
		<p><strong>Utility and the Law of Demand</strong> = As the price of a good increases, the utility of the marginal dollar spent on the good decreases, since the marginal dollar buys less of the good.&nbsp; The consumer reallocates the marginal dollar away from the good, causing quantity demanded to fall in line with the <strong>Law of Demand</strong>.</p>
		<p><strong>Law of Demand</strong> = Increase in price causes decrease in quantity demanded.</p>
		<p><strong>Law of Supply</strong> = Increase in price causes increase in quantity supplied.</p><br>
		<strong>Four Key Elements of Finance:</strong>
		<ol>
			<li>reallocates economic value through time</li>
			<li>reallocates risk</li>
			<li>reallocates captial</li>
			<li>expands the access to, and the complexity of, these reallocations</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="p1">Financial contracts are typically between someone who wants to shift value to the present and someone who wants to shift value to the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> Two reasons to shift value to the present: consumption and production.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> Consumption covers: current expenses, buy food, pay medical bills, deal with unforeseen cost.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> Consumption loans mitigate risks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> Governments also take loans from citizens (bond) and pay back with future tax revenues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="p1">Consumption and production use current capital; investment provides that capital.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> It is the basic technology for saving for the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> That is why pension funds hold stocks and bonds and other financial assets. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="p1">Productive loans are different from consumption loans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> They are used for economic growth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> Finance can bring capital together to create an enterprise that will generate higher future value.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span> Additionally, finance removes the perquisite of wealth from entrepreneurship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

			Macroeconomics
		</div><br>
		<p><strong>Opportunity Cost =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Give up one choice for another better choice and a better way to spend one&rsquo;s time.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Macroeconomics =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bigger picture, GDP, Unemployment rate, interest rates, deficit.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><strong>Microeconomics =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">How firms work.&nbsp; How much labor they hire to make a profit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><strong>Incentives =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">External motivations that explain people&rsquo;s choices.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Scarcity =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans working with finite resources and unlimited wants.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><strong>Benefits and Costs =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs outweigh benefits.&nbsp; Example, banning ALL cars because a tiny fraction of deadly accidents will lead to people walking, trains.&nbsp; Benefits are not there.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Industrial Revolution =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">raises standard of living, increased population and standard of living.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam Smith division of labor = A pizza man should make pizza and trade it for a guy who can make t-shirts, instead of trying to do everything.</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most nations have a mixed economy like the United States, but North Korea has a controlled economy, where the government controls the economy.&nbsp; Moreover, New Zealand is laissez a faire (less government).&nbsp;</span></p>

		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four market behaviors</span></p>
		<ol>
			<li style="font-weight: 500;"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Supply can go &#x2193;</span></li>
			<li style="font-weight: 500;"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Supply can go &#8593;&nbsp;</span></li>

			<li style="font-weight: 500;"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Demand can go &#8593;&nbsp;</span></li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Supply and Demand =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers and producers agree on price and production.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Law of Demand =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices go up, consumers buy less.&nbsp; Conversely, Prices go down, people buy more.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Law of Supply =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices go up, producers make a profit, will produce more goods (or services). Conversely, price goes down, producers profits go down, which leads to a curtail in production.</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the price goes up, producers produce lots of strawberries, but consumers wouldn&rsquo;t want to buy them.&nbsp; This is a surplus.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><strong>Equilibrium Price =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The price at which quantity of a product offered is equal.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Equilibrium Quantity =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The quantity demanded or supplied at equilibrium price.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

		<p><strong>Three types of unemployment</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Frictional Unemployment =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The time period between jobs when a worker is searching for a job, or transitioning from a job.</span> <strong>Example, the new employees entering the workforce from college</strong>&nbsp;</li>
			<li><strong><strong>Structural Employment =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Unemployment caused by a lack of demand for workers&rsquo; specific type of labor.</span> <strong>Example, VCR repairman. Moreover,&nbsp; the example of employees being replaced by robots.</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></strong>&nbsp;</li>
			<li><strong>Cyclical unemployment =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">people stop buying goods leads to businesses layoff workers and in turn those laid off workers stop buying goods and more people lose their jobs.&nbsp;</span> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
		</ol>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">0% unemployment is impossible due to frictional and structural employment.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Real GDP and Unemployment are inversely related.&nbsp;</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Business Cycle</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">= Changes in four components:&nbsp;</span></p>
		<ol>
			<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer spending</span></li>
			<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business spending</span></li>
			<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net exports</span></li>
			<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes in speed of economy</span></li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Productivity =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is the ability to produce more output, per worker, per hour.&nbsp; An increase in productivity is better for the country.&nbsp; Look up Singapore.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><strong>Factors of Production =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Land, labor, capital.&nbsp; Human capital = education, skills, knowledge.</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital has a cost, but finding new ways to organize production is virtually free technology.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Purchasing power =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Amount of goods and services that can be bought by a given amount of money.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Inflation =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase in a currency supply.&nbsp; Number of people using the currency increases, resulting in rising prices of goods and services overtime.&nbsp; Look up Venezuela&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><strong>Bubbles =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Surges in asset prices to the levels significantly above the value of the asset.&nbsp; Housing bubble.&nbsp; Look up NINJA loans.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><strong>CPI = Consumer Price Index,</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">shows how prices have changed in different years.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Real =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">price from past adjusted for inflation.&nbsp; Nominal is not adjusted.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Demand pull inflation =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Too much money chasing too few goods.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Supply Shock =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Decrease in oil production, leads to increase in gasoline price, which leads to increase in delivery costs and the pizza prices.&nbsp; Thus, people will not buy pizza.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></span></p>
		<p><strong>Fiscal Policy =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Government intervention by government spending or taxes.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Recessionary Gap =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">situation wherein the real GDP is lower than the potential GDP at the full employment level.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Inflationary Gap</strong> =&nbsp; When unemployment is low, factories work overtime, but this is not sustainable.&nbsp; Producers will bid up costs leading to more inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><strong>Expansionary Fiscal Policy =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Stimulate the economy during or in anticipation of a business-cycle contraction (Obama 2009).</span></p>
		<p><strong>Contractionary Fiscal Policy =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce the money supply and ultimately the spending in a country. This is rarely implemented (Bush 1993).</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Budget Deficit</strong> = Amount of which a government&rsquo;s spending exceeds its income over a particular period of time.</span></p>
		<p><em><img alt="Barnhart" height="110" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/831583d2-f625-423f-a73f-e837a3edda8b%2F554420DB-C858-4C09-B088-61FBD00F812E.png?v=1601502113784" width="100"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists are focused on federal deficit as to percentage of GDP rather than federal debt (adjusted for inflation)</span></em></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Debt</strong> = Accumulation of budget deficits.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p></p>
		<p><strong>Central Bank has two roles:</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulate and oversee that the nation&rsquo;s commercial banks have enough money in reserve to avoid bank runs.</span></li>
			<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conduct monetary policy by increasing or decreasing the money supply to speed up or slow down the economy.</span></li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Interest rate = price of borrowing money.&nbsp; When banks lend money, they expect to be repaid the amount lended.&nbsp; This is known as the principle.&nbsp; A percentage of principle covers inflation and enough to make a profit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Financial System</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">= A network of institutions, markets, and contracts that bring lenders and borrowers together.&nbsp; Banks, Bond Markets, Stock Market.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Fluctuations in the stock market are not reliable indicators of how the economy is doing.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>HyperInflation = Confusion on what prices to charge for products.&nbsp; Moreover, forces consumers to spend as quickly as possible rather than save money.&nbsp; Therefore, there is no money to be invested in businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Velocity of money =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">number of times a dollar is spent per year.&nbsp; When people spend their money as quickly as they get it, that increases velocity, which pushes inflation up an even faster vicious cycle.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><strong>Liquidity Trap =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuing falling prices leads to layoffs and economic depression.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p><strong>Stagflation =</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Output slows down or stops at the same time price rises.</span></p>

		<p>Due Diligence begins with an initial research of the business. Why is the business for sale? How is the business perceived? Will the business stay profitable. Connect with business associations, speak to customers and inquire about asking price. Determine the value of the business: inventory, debt, location.</p>
		<p>Approach to the value of the business. Asset-based: The value of the business is determined on the costs to replace the tangible assets. If the earnings will not support the value greater than the assets. Then at best, the business' value equals the value of tangible assets</p>
		<p>Market based uses ratios or factors derived from: earnings, sales, assets, of past transactions of similar businesses. Apply to this to the business you are seeking to buy</p>
		<p>Income based dervies indication of value by Capitalization or Discount rate</p>
		<p>There are three options for buying a business. Outright sale: ownership is transferred immediately.<br>
		Payment is excepted right away.</p>
		<p>Gradual Sale: Flexible option transferring a business which often benefits individual who cannot afford to purchase a business through an outright sale, but are instead able to fiance a long-term payment plan.</p>
		<p>Lease Agreement: Committing to a contract that details the conditions and payments you will make for the temporary rights to the business.</p>
		<p>Sales agreement: key document to finalize the purchase of the business.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You require a sales agreement to:</li>
			<li>Buy a business legally.</li>
			<li>Finalize the purchase of the business.</li>

			<li>What is the state of the industry in which the business operates? Is the industry in growth mode, or is it mature or in decline?</li>
			<li>What is the state of the business’s target market? Is its target market growing or shrinking? Are its target customers undergoing demographic changes, such as aging, loss of disposable income, or other transitions that could put the business at risk?</li>
			<li>Is the business’s customer base growing? Is the business adequately diversified, or is it overly dependent on one or two big customers?</li>
			<li>How does this business compare to competitors in its industry? How many competitors are there? What are their strengths and weaknesses?</li>
			<li>What is the state of the region where the business is located? Are people moving into the area or are they moving out? What about businesses? Is the local economy growing or shrinking?</li>
			<li>What kind of staff does the business have? Do employees have skills that are difficult to find elsewhere? Are their wages average, above average, or below average for the industry? What benefits does the company offer?</li>
			<li>Is there a lot of turnover at the company? How long have key employees been with the company? Are key personnel likely to stay with the company after a change in ownership?</li>
			<li>What is the company’s reputation in the industry and the community? Businesses are often up for sale because of problems the owner may try to hide. Go online and ask around in the community to learn as much as you can about the reputation the company has among customers, vendors, and prospects.</li>

		<p><a href="https://www.businessbroker.net/blog/buying-a-franchise-or-business/5-key-metrics-to-look-at-when-comparing-businesses-for-sale-deciding-to-buy">Source</a></p>
		<p><strong>1. Product or Process</strong></p>
		<p>You have to be interested in the the service or product (or the combo of both).</p>
		<p><strong>2. Business Plan</strong></p>
		<p>Look at their business plan. See how their goals align with yours. Their plan should show how the product/process is marketed. In addition, check out how similar companies stack up in sales. If they don't have a business plan but their is potential, then create your own plan.</p>
		<p><strong>3. Financial</strong></p>
		<p>If the business does not have solid financial documents, walk away. Financial documents are the health of the business <a href="https://kironroy.github.io/four">Source</a></p>
		<p><strong>4. Customers</strong></p>
		<p>Know the current customers as well as web-mapping the area with <i>Google map and <a href="https://www.trulia.com/?cid=sem|google|tbw_nb_nat_x_ht_nat_homes(hv)!3757af49|Homes-Broad_352776865_22475177305_kwd-10115540_223899029214_">trulia</a></i>. <strong>Key metrics:</strong> demographics, adjacencies. <strong>Then determine:</strong> market saturation, or potential growth.</p>
		<p><strong>5. Performance and Progress</strong></p>
		<p>The efficiency of the business. Workers adequately working? This would reflect in the expense and income columns. Is the owner active, or is there a manager, sub-managers?</p>

			5 Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
		</div>
		<p><a href="https://www.allbusiness.com/buying-a-business-5-essential-kpis-to-review-112437-1.html">Source</a></p>
		<p><strong>1. Customer acquisition cost</strong></p><strong>Customer acquisition cost = dollar amount you spend on sales and marketing in order to require a new customer.</strong> The number indicates efficiency of marketing and is calculated by <i>Total number of customers / Total acquisition costs</i>. If the company you are looking at is spending too much, consider the options of refining the marketing strategy and more efficiently allocating the budget.
		<p></p>
		<p><strong>2. Customer retention rate</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Customer retention rate = customers who come back regularly for goods and services</strong> High retention rates include: <i>High quality product at a competitive price, customer support, and customer satisfaction.</i></p>
		<p><strong>3. Profit margin</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Profit margin = "markup" how much a product or service's revenue exceeds its cost to the business.</strong> Business with low margins are vulnerable to drops in sales or poor market share. This will raise concern about long-term sustainability.</p>
		<p><strong>4. Overhead</strong></p><strong>refers to fixed expenses outside labor and production costs.</strong> Rent, utilities, and insurance are all examples of overhead expenses. When compared to overall revenue, overhead can indicate a company’s efficiency.
		<p></p>
		<p><strong>5. Employee turnover</strong></p>
		<p>High employee turnover could be a red flag that current management isn’t engaging staff or rewarding strong individual or company performance. If you’re considering a business with high turnover, revamp employee policies.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Properties Won vs Property lost: Property managers need to track how many properties successfully acquired within a year.</li>
			<li>Occupancy rates: should be 95 to 96% at any given time</li>
			<li>Average Arrears (debt, money owed to you) can impact a company's cash flow. Always try to minimize arrears</li>
			<li>Tenant turnover: Unless, you are managing rent controlled properties, it is common for tenants to turn over every year or two.</li>
			<li>Rent-Ready costs: when a unit turns over, do you know how much it will cost to get the unit in rent-ready condition?</li>
			<li>Average Days-to-Lease: Each day passes without a resident occupying a unit is money being lost</li>
			<li>Net-Income: Besides tracking rent, track other revenue streams like washer and dryer costs</li>
			<li>Repair and maintenance cost: Property maintenance should line up reputable service companies, know specific cost of repair (example: bathroom remodeling)</li>
			<li>Property management fees usually 8 to 12%</li>
			<li>Revenue growth</li>

			Financial Accounting (Libby, Libby, and Short)
		</div>
		<p>Most companies list assets in order of liquidity or how soon an asset is expected by management to be turned into cash or used. Liabilities are usually listed on the balance sheet in order of maturity (how soon an obligation is to be paid). Managers business decisions often result in transactions that affect the financial statement. Decisions to expand the number of stores, advertise a new product, change and employee benefit package and invest excess cash would affect the financial statement. The decision to purchase additional inventory for cash in anticipation of a major sales will increase inventory and decrease cash. But if there is no demand for additional inventory, the lower cash balance will also reduce the company’s ability to pay its other obligations.</p>
		<p>Operating Cycle: The long term objective for any business is to turn cash into more cash. If a company is to stay in business, this excess must be generated from operations that is from activities for which the business was established, not from borrowing money or selling long-lived assets.</p>

			<h3>Business Operations</h3>
		</center>
		<p><strong>Financing, Operating and Investing are the three major activities in business operations.</strong> Financing deals with the initial startup of the business as well funding the business throughout its lifetime. When a business owner seeks a loan from a bank or SBA, issues stock to investors, or a combination of both, the owner becomes part of the <strong>capital market</strong>.</p>
		<p><strong>Investing</strong> has to do with buying tools for a business. Examples: a cash register, machinery, land.</p>
		<p><strong>Operating activity</strong> takes care of day-to-day operations of a business by selling/creating products, providing services, or both.</p>
		<p>Business creates a enormous amount of <strong>data</strong>. Think of how many sales a single <i>Walmart</i> makes in a day!</p>

			Cash Flow Statement
		</div>
		<p><strong>Cash flow statement</strong> is the checkbook of the business. It covers a period of time vs. a snapshot (balance sheet)</p>
		<p>Cash flow covers transactions from <strong>operations, financing, and investing.</strong></p>
		<p>Cash is a liquid asset on the Balance Sheet <i>A = L + E</i></p>
		<p><i>Liquidity</i> is a termed used to denote whether or not a business is generating cash from its assets or convert its assets into cash quickly</p>
		<p>Cash is <strong>not profit.</strong> A business can generate a cash but not necessarily make a profit. Conversely, a profitable business doesn't necessarily have cash-flow.</p>
		<p><strong>When validating a business, most investors look at the cash-flow statement, rather than the income statement. This is to check if there is a healthy flow of money going into the business, then coming out of it.</strong></p><br>
		<div class="title2">
			Balance Sheet
		</div>
		<p><strong>The Balance Sheet</strong> is a snapshot (instance in time). It measures the financial condition of a business with respect to its total assets and claims or rights to those assets. Note the balance statement does not <strong>change over time</strong>.</p>
		<p>Most important Equation: <strong><i>Assets = Liabilities + Owner Equity</i></strong></p>
		<p>Balance sheet insolvency: <strong><i>Assets &lt; Liabilities + Owner Equity</i></strong> Think of a house that you bought for $200k but now is worth $140k. Even if you sell all your assets you cannot payoff the liabilities.</p>
		<p>Balance sheet insolvency is different than <strong>cash flow insolvency</strong>, in that a business may have assets, but cannot convert the assets quickly enough to pay bills (Also known as <strong>liquidity</strong>).</p><br>
		<div class="title2">
			Income Statement
		</div>
		<p><strong>Income statement</strong> shows booked income and the costs and expenses associated with making that income.</p>
		<p>Income statement <strong>DOES NOT show cash-flow</strong>. Cash flow is separate statement.</p><br>
		<div class="title2">
			Earnings Statement
		</div>
		<p><strong>Retained Earnings Statement</strong> reports accumulated retained earnings at beginning of the year and the addition of any net income that will be added to that retained earnings.</p>
		<p><i>Retained Earnings = Previous R.E. + Net Income - Dividends Paid</i></p>
		<p>It also reports dividends issued to investors. Dividends are cash payments made out to shareholders and are an type of cash out-flow.</p>
		<p>Three things can be determined by the Earnings statement:</p>
		<p>1. Give some or all money (dividends) to investors</p>
		<p>2. Save the money for inside the business</p>
		<p>3. Combination of 1 and 2</p>
		<p>Retained earning <strong>does not</strong> report what is done with the retained earnings or cash-flow. It just reports the earnings.</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL41BF20388A0E8CD0">Source</a><br>
